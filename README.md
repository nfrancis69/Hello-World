# Hello-World
New repository for a new programmer
I am new to the coding world, but figured since I am unemployed what do I have to lose.  I am also interested in crocheting, making beaded jewelry, baking, and I love The Big Bang Theory.  Other than that, I am just your average, middle aged mother living in the burbs.
